## 🔧 Components Used

- ESP32 Microcontroller  
- MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter Sensor  
- MPU9250 Accelerometer + Gyroscope  
- Blynk IoT App  
- Arduino IDE

---

## 💡 Features

- Real-time heart rate monitoring
- Fall detection based on motion sensors
- Emergency alert notification system
- Data visualization on mobile using Blynk

---

## 📲 How It Works

1. Heart rate is read using the MAX30102 sensor.
2. MPU9250 detects motion/fall patterns.
3. ESP32 sends data to the Blynk app via Wi-Fi.
4. If a fall is detected or heart rate exceeds threshold, emergency notification is triggered.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Install libraries:
   - `Adafruit MAX30102`
   - `MPU9250`
   - `Blynk`
2. Upload `main_code.ino` to ESP32 using Arduino IDE.
3. Configure your Blynk app with your auth token.
4. Connect ESP32 to Wi-Fi and start monitoring via Blynk dashboard.
